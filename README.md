# Website Landing Page
This is a generic landing page for a company built from scratch using flexbox.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This landing page was built by separating the content into different containers that could then be organized separately using flexbox. This site is a great starting point for a variety of businesses looking to create an online presence and can be tailored to fit any needs.


## Lessons Learned:

The key takeaway from this website was the power that flexbox has to easily format content. Once I was decided where I wanted each section to start and end, it was much easier to move things around independently from the whole page. 

Another key learning moment was how different elements could be combined in the CSS to eliminate redundancies in the code and keep the CSS clean and easy to read and navigate.
